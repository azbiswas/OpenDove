This code implements the DOVE Connectivity Services (DCS).
The DOVE Connectivity Services is designed as a runtime database that is
configured from by the ODL/DOVE controller and maintains runtime data
about location of VMs on various tenants. It supports querying of information
regarding the location of VMs and in some cases provides updates to its
clients (DOVE Switches and Gateways) regarding changes in the DOVE environment
for e.g. Broadcast Lists, Multicast Lists, Policy changes etc.

CODE LANGUAGE
-------------
The Code is designed to run as a single process on a DOVE Service Appliance or
any Linux-based OS system. It's comprised of code written in C and Python. The
C code is compiled into a dynamically load(able) library that can be invoked
by the Python scripts. Each component on the DCS is written in either C or
Python.

The C/Python interaction is implemented using simple Extension and Embedding
Techniques. The Python libraries and header files needed to compile the DCS 
is described in the README_PYTHON file.

CODE LAYOUT
-----------
Each folder in the code repository implements a specific functionality.

init - Contains the initialization files and files for functionality that 
       was too simple to have a folder of its own for e.g. logging.

inc - Contains all the header files that are used by all components

fd_process - File descriptor processing routine. Currently implemented using
             "poll" since the number descriptors are 2-3 but should be
             converted to "epoll" at some time.

client_server_protocol - The (currently) UDP based communication channel 
                         between clients (DOVE Switches and Gateways) and 
                         the DCS.

data_hander - Handles the run-time database of objects stored in the DCS.


COMPILING
---------
Prerequisites: Compile on any RedHAT type system (Ubuntu or Fedora works just
               fine though you may need to download some packages depending on
               your environment, e.g., python-dev, libjansson-dev, libevent-dev, openssl).
               READ the PYTHON_README file and download the necessary files.
               The os_distributor_script file must be made executable (chmod +x)
               make - To build, the executable files and .pyc scripts are in the 
                      "build" directory.
               make clean - To delete the compiled files.

RUNNING:
--------
After compiling, goto the "build" directory, type "dcs_server.py". 
"dcs_server.py" is the starting script. The list of parameters will be
shown if the incorrect number of parameters are entered.
