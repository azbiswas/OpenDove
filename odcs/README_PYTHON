'python-config' utility is needed to find out what compilation flags to use.
Depending on the linux distribution the correct package needs to be installed. 
    Fedora machine: installing 'python-devel' also installed python-config.
    Ubuntu machine: installing 'python-dev' also installed python-config

Once python-config is installed run the following commands to find out the 
compilation flags to be used in the Makefile.

python-config --includes
python-config --libs
python-config --cflags
python-config --ldflags

Without the correct flags compilation will FAIL.
