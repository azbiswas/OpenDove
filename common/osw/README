This folder contains the OS wrapper (OSW) common module.

The OS wrapper includes:
. thread creation and deletion
. event send and receive
. semaphore creation and deletion and take and release
. message queue creation and deletion and send and receive
. timer

Here message queue supports both POSIX message queue and 
Non-POSIX message queue. By default, it works in POSIX message
queue mode. If kernel in which the OS wrapper is running not 
support POSIX message queue, you have to change to Non-POSIX
message queue. To change to Non-POSIX, you need to recompile 
the queue.c with -DNON_POSIX_MQUEUE flag.

In addition, timer granularity is 100ms, that is, expired time 
MUST be multiple of 100ms.
