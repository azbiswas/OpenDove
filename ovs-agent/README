DOVE agent for Open vSwitch:
---------------------------

The agent needs to be compiled with the openvswitch source code.
You will need to download the latest openvswitch source code (version
1.11.0 or higher) and compile it on your system.

You may use the getdeps.sh script in the opendove/third-party
directory to download and build Open vSwitch.


Then do the following:

1. Set the OVS_DIR in the Makefile to the openvswitch source code directory

2. Ensure the the Open DOVE Connectivity Server objects are built (run 'make'
in the opendove/odcs directory).
	
3. Run 'make' in the ovs-agent directory

4. Run dove-controller:
	sudo ./dove-controller ptcp: -d <dps_ip>
