DOVE agent for Open vSwitch:
---------------------------

The agent needs to be compiled with the openvswitch source code (release 2.0.0)

You may use the getdeps.sh script in the opendove/third-party
directory to download and build Open vSwitch.

INSTALL:
1. Ensure the the Open DOVE Connectivity Server objects are built (run 'make'
in the opendove/odcs directory).
2. Run 'make' in the ovs-agent directory

RUN:
1. Run setup:
   $ sudo ./setup-dove.sh <loacl_ip> <dcs_ip>
   that will create dove datapath on the openvswitch and run the DOVE agent
   daemon.
2. Connect VM to dove:
   $ sudo ./add-port.sh <PORT_NAME> <VNID> [VM_IP] [VM_NET_MASK] [VM_GW_IP]
3. Disconnect VM from dove:
   $ sudo ./del-port.sh <PORT_NAME>
